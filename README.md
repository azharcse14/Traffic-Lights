# Traffic-Lights

Tools & Technology: Arduino UNO, 220Ohm Resistor, 10kOhm Resistor, pushbutton, LED, Arduino IDE & C.
Details: In this project are going to build a traffic lights system:
•	There are 3 LEDs with different colors (green, yellow and red) to mimic the traffic lights for the cars.
•	There are 2 LEDs with different colors (green and red) to mimic the traffic lights for the pedestrians.
•	There is a pushbutton to mimic the ones in the pedestrians traffic lights.
